# Learn to Code: Snake Game

## Design Phase

* Go to [https://saholman.github.io/snakegame/solution/index.html](https://saholman.github.io/snakegame/solution/index.html) and check out the example.
* On a blank piece of paper, design what you want your game to look like.
	* Pick a background color
	* Draw the size you want the game board to be.
	* Give it an awesome title
	* Pick a text color
	* Pick a font size
	* Pick a snake color
	* Pick an apple color

* When you begin buiding, you will need to make a few more decisions.
	* Pick a message to show when you lose.
	* How fast do you want your snake to move (a number between 1 and 10)
	* How long do you want your snake to start out as?

## Build Phase
* Download a zip file of this project from Github.
* Open the file `index.html` in Notepad++ or another text editor. (If you've ever done coding before, use `challenge.html` instead.  You can do it!

Now search through the document for the word `FIXME` and see if you can figure out where the answers to the above questions go.  Start out by changing the title.

If you decided to try `challenge.html`, then you'll find the same questions above, but a few more adventures await you.

Good luck!
